Controls overlay options

```js
const options = {
  overlay: {

  }
}
```

### `interceptTouchOutside`
Controls whether touch events outside the bounds of the overlay are to be handled by content behind the overlay. When set to true, touch events will **not** pass through to the underlying content.

| Type  | Required | Platform |
| ----- | -------- | -------- |
| boolean | No       | Both     |

**Note for Android**: This option now correctly makes the overlay container transparent to touches when set to `false`. The overlay container itself will not consume touch events, allowing them to reach underlying views. This fixes long-standing issues where overlays were blocking touches even with `interceptTouchOutside: false`.

### `handleKeyboardEvents`
Overlays on iOS don't handle keyboard events by default. If your Overlay contains a TextInput component, you'll want to enable this option so that TextInput responds to keyboard events.

| Type   | Required | Platform |
| ------ | -------- | -------- |
| boolean | No       | iOS     |
