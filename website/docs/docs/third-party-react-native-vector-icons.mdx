react-native-vector-icons is a very popular library for using SVG icons in react-native, which keeps large static images
out of your app while providing crisp icons. Using this library with React Native Navigation is not difficult, but does take
a few extra steps..

## Using SVG icons in BottomTabs or TopBarButtons

In the example below we will detail a simple app that pre-loads several icons from react-native-vector-icons to be used in our navigation. The example assumes
you have worked through the [installation](https://github.com/oblador/react-native-vector-icons#installation) and optional steps to support [custom fonts](https://github.com/oblador/react-native-vector-icons#custom-fonts)
according to the react-native-vector-icons project.

### Step 1 - Choose icons and load image source.

The core issue here is that React Native Navigation wants 'images' for its icons while react-native-vector-icon typically works as a component. However,
there is a way around this, by using the `getImageSource` method exposed by react-native-vector-icons.

The only catch is that this is an asynchronous functions. To workaround this, we create a central file that references all the icons we will be using in our navigation
components, and ensure it is preloaded before we launch the app.

```tsx file=./third-party-react-native-vector-icons/NavIcons.tsx
```

### Step 2 - Launching the app.

We now launch our app in the usual fashion, however before constructing the root component which references our icons, we ensure that the `iconsLoaded` Promise has resolved

```tsx file=./third-party-react-native-vector-icons/index.ts
```

### Step 3 - Using NavIcons in components.

One of the nice features of React Native Navigation is that it is possible to specify the navigation 'options' on each individual component. This still works with NavIcons
framework we have setup, provided our options are specified as a function (so that the promises are fully resolved before they are executed):


```tsx file=./third-party-react-native-vector-icons/ExampleComponent.tsx
```
